# ENGR562_CNN
This Repository containg the notebooks used in the Article 'A study of Convolutional Neural Networks' [Sorensen(2019)]. Theoretical knowlagde on CNNs are given there.  The following repository contains

- How to make a model: Combined with the article, this notebook gives a full overview on on how to make a CNN model using the Keras library in Pyhon. The TenserFlow framework is used due to its simplicity.  The model goes through how to: Get data, prepare mode, make model, train model, evaluate model and illustrate model.

- Activation functions: In 'A study of Convolutional Neural Networks' [Sorensen(2019)], different activation functions have been given. In this notebook, the accuracty for a model given a specific Activation function is seen. The result is that the ReLU function is better.
